## More Information
The main idea for this project is using a compiled programming language create a close version of the game 'Who Am I?'. So, the project are divided in 2 areas, the client and the server side. To play the game, you need to start the server application and start *n* players applications (but you have to connect until 30 seconds after the server side was started). The game has a master player who choose a word and give a tip about it. The other players have to make a question and make a guess, and someone guess the word right another round with another master player is selected.

The software (the both parts) were developed in C#, but the speaking language was Portuguese.
